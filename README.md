# GAPI

This is a React Native app using Expo that allows users to search public repositories on Github and view repository details. The app uses the Github API to fetch repository data and displays the results in a scrollable list with cards for each repository.

## Features

- Search for public repositories on Github using a search term
- Sort repositories by stars, watchers count, score, name, created date, and last updated date
- View repository details, including the repository name, owner's login name, avatar, description, language, and last update timestamp

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danishsshaikh/GAPI.git
cd GAPI
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

To search for repositories, enter a search term in the search field and press the search button. The app will then fetch repository data from the Github API and display the results in a list. You can sort the list by stars, watchers count, score, name, created date, and last updated date using the sort buttons.
